Govee H5055 BBQ Thermometer MQTT Gateway

I started with Openhab recently. As i was looking for devices to connect, i thought about connecting my bbq thermometer (govee h5055) to openhab.
As i am passionate in bbq, i thought it would be nice to have the charts of my next pulled pork on my raspberry.

I went on the internet to find a repo but there wasn't one on that specific device. But I found this great repo:

Thanks to Eric!

It took me some time to decode the bits and bytes of the govee communication but now it is working.
